  <h1>Game Description Guidelines</h1>

    <p>general guidelines</p>

  <ul>

    <li>While this is not Wikipedia, use of a neutral point of view is encouraged.</li>

    <li>When linking to games, link to the game page using [gameid=NUMBER].</li>

    <li>For descriptive terms that apply to many games, link to an appropriate wiki page, even if that page does not yet exist. For example, "This game is language neutral" or this game was illustrated by Doris Matth√§us. (These two examples are now inapplicable, as there are BGG modules for both of these now, but the concept of this item is still relevant.)</li>

   </ul>

   <p>The wiki Game Descriptions are not meant to be a place to implement other new features such as ratings by number-of-players, personal categorizations (use Tags), or the like.</p>

   <h1>Things to include on a game wiki page</h1>

   <ul>

     <li>A brief description of the game. This should always appear as the first part of the page. A good game description covers theme, game-play, and goal.</li>

     <li>A list of awards, linked the the appropriate wiki award page (eg, Spiel des Jahres). This should go in the More Information section. As of 2012, Awards are in a transition period and are being incorporated into a specific module. As honors and awards information becomes more-complete in this module, the relevance or necessity of listing awards in the description is waning.</li>

     <li>Links to other related games e.g. other games in the same series, or older versions, along with a description of the relationship between these games. It is worth noting that current BGG modules can link together base-games and expansions, and can link together series and related games through Families.</li>

     <li>Links to wiki pages with extended details about a game, for example if a game has a large number of different editions with a great deal of information about each, you may create a wiki page dedicated to the various editions of a game and simply link to it in the main Game Wiki page.</li>

     <li>For children's games, the age range suggested by the publisher.</li>

   </ul>


    <h1>Things to NOT include on a game wiki page</h1>

   <ul>

     <li>Links to designers/publishers/categories that are already included in the game entry, unless the name already is a natural part of the text.</li>

     <li>Rules questions, reviews, discussion, opinions, announcements, or other content that belongs in the Forums</li>

     <li>Images</li>

     <li>Links to external web sites (these belong in the game links)</li>

     <li>Rules suggestions or other things that belong in files or forums</li>

     <li>Recommendations, which currently are best discussed in the forums</li>

     <li>Categories the game is in except as noted above</li>

     <li>Information about the "in-print" status of the game should be avoided, as print and availability are nebulous qualities at best and the relative speed at which descriptions are updated nearly guarantees that this information will be inaccurate or out-of-date. The versions system is designed to list release data, and integrates with Gone Cardboard for forthcoming publications</li>
