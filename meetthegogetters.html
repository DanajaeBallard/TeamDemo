         <h4>Hi my name is Brian McNeil and for the pass summer I was the Go Getters team captain. This summer I had lots of fun learning how to build my own website. There were many challenges we have faced in building our websites but as a team we overcame them and got the job done.  My team has identified me as the best group leader in the whole program. So at the end of the program I had lots of fun working and competing with my peers. </h4>

Englewood Codes taught me how to build a website using Html, CSS, JavaScript, Twitter Bootstrap, and Github.</h4>
